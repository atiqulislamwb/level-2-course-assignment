Question 1: What is the purpose of creating a model with an interface and schema in MongoDB? How does it help in defining the structure of a collection?

Answer: By using an interface and schema, developer can specify the fields, data types, and validation rules for documents stored in a collection. This helps ensure consistency and integrity of the data, as well as provides a clear understanding of the expected structure.

The interface defines the methods and operations that can be performed on the documents in the collection, such as querying, updating, and deleting. It helps in organizing and encapsulating the database interactions within the model.

The schema, on the other hand, defines the structure of the documents, including the field names, their data types, and any validation constraints. It allows you to enforce data integrity by specifying required fields, unique values, data formats, and more

Question 2: Explain the concept of field filtering in MongoDB. How can you specify which fields to include or exclude in the returned documents?

Answer: Field filtering in MongoDB refers to the ability to specify which fields should be included or excluded in the returned documents when querying a collection. It allows you to control the shape and size of the data returned by a query, returning only the fields that are relevant to your application or query requirements.

In MongoDB, field filtering can be achieved using the projection parameter in the find() method or the aggregate framework. There are two main approaches to specifying field filtering:

Inclusion Projection: You can explicitly specify the fields that you want to include in the returned documents. This is done by providing a projection document as the second argument to the find() method or as part of the $project stage in the aggregate pipeline. The projection document contains field names as keys with a value of 1 to include the field.

Example:
db.collection.find({}, { field1: 1, field2: 1 })

Exclusion Projection: Alternatively, you can specify the fields that you want to exclude from the returned documents. This is done by providing a projection document as the second argument to the find() method or as part of the $project stage in the aggregate pipeline. The projection document contains field names as keys with a value of 0 to exclude the field.

Example:
db.collection.find({}, { field3: 0, field4: 0 })

Question 3: What are instance methods in MongoDB models? Provide an example of a custom instance method and explain its purpose.

Answer: In MongoDB models, instance methods are custom methods that can be defined on individual model instances. These methods are specific to each instance and can be used to perform custom operations or encapsulate business logic related to that instance.

Instance methods in MongoDB models are typically defined using the methods property of the schema.

Example:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define a schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
name: String,
age: Number,
email: String
});

// Define an instance method
userSchema.methods.getFullName = function() {
return this.name;
};

// Create a model using the schema
const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Create an instance of the model
const user = new User({
name: 'Kitty',
age: 15,
email: 'kity@example.com'
});

// Call the custom instance method
const fullName = user.getFullName();
console.log(fullName); // Output: "Kitty"

Question 4: How do you use comparison operators like "$ne," "$gt," "$lt," "$gte," and "$lte" in MongoDB queries? Provide examples to illustrate their usage.

Answer: In MongoDB queries, comparison operators such as "$ne" (not equal), "$gt" (greater than), "$lt" (less than), "$gte" (greater than or equal to), and "$lte" (less than or equal to) are used to perform comparisons on field values.

1."$ne" (not equal):
db.collection.find({ age: { $ne: 25 } })

2."$gt" (greater than):
db.collection.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } })

3."$lt" (less than):
db.collection.find({ age: { $lt: 40 } })

4."$gte" (greater than or equal to):
db.collection.find({ age: { $gte: 25 } })

5."$lte" (less than or equal to):
db.collection.find({ age: { $lte: 50 } })

Question 5: What are MongoDB’s “$in” and “$nin” operators? How can you use them to match values against an array of values or exclude values from a given array?

Answer:MongoDB's "$in" and "$nin" operators are used to match or exclude values against an array of values in a MongoDB query

1."$in" operator:
db.collection.find({ color: { $in: ['red', 'blue', 'green'] } })

2.$nin" operator:
db.collection.find({ color: { $nin: ['yellow', 'orange', 'purple'] } })

Question 6: Explain the logical operators "$and," "$or," "$not," and "$nor" in MongoDB queries. Provide examples to demonstrate their usage.

Answer: In MongoDB queries, the logical operators "$and," "$or," "$not," and "$nor" are used to combine multiple conditions and perform logical operations on them.

1."$and" operator:
db.collection.find({ $and: [{ age: { $gte: 25 } }, { age: { $lte: 40 } }] })
2."$or" operator:
db.collection.find({ $or: [{ color: 'red' }, { color: 'blue' }] })
3."$not" operator:
db.collection.find({ age: { $not: { $gt: 30 } } })
4."$nor" operator:
db.collection.find({ $nor: [{ color: 'red' }, { size: 'large' }] })

Question 7: What is the difference between the "explicit" and "implicit" "$and" operations in MongoDB? How does each behave when combining multiple conditions?

Answer: In MongoDB, the "explicit" and "implicit" "$and" operations refer to two different ways of combining multiple conditions using the "$and" operator.

1.Explicit "$and" operation:
db.collection.find({ $and: [{ condition1 }, { condition2 }, { condition3 }] })
2.Implicit "$and" operation:
db.collection.find({ condition1, condition2, condition3 })

Question 8: How do you use the "$exists" operator in MongoDB to check if a field exists or not in a document? Provide an example.

Answer:In MongoDB, the "$exists" operator is used to check if a field exists or not in a document. It evaluates to true if the field exists and false if the field does not exist.

db.collection.find({ field: { $exists: true } })

$exists" operator to check for the absence of a field by setting its value to false:

db.collection.find({ field: { $exists: false } })

Question 9: What is the purpose of the "$type" operator in MongoDB? How can you use it to match documents based on the data type of a field?

Answer:In MongoDB, the "$type" operator is used to match documents based on the data type of a field. It allows you to perform queries that filter documents based on the specific data types present in a field.
The "$type" operator takes an integer value representing the BSON data type and matches documents where the specified field has the corresponding data type.

db.collection.find({ field: { $type: <data_type> } })

Question 10:Explain the use of the "$size" operator in MongoDB. How does it work when querying documents based on the size of an array field?

Answer:In MongoDB, the "$size" operator is used to query documents based on the size of an array field. It allows you to find documents where the specified array field has a specific number of elements.

db.collection.find({ arrayField: { $size: <array_size> } })

or example, let's say you have a collection of documents with an "items" field, which is an array. You can use the "$size" operator to find documents where the "items" array has a specific number of elements, such as 3:

db.collection.find({ items: { $size: 3 } })
